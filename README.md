- Currently working on an environmental website/web app. Hidden for the time being until I have enough to properly showcase the project!

- 👋 <b>Hi, I’m @c0deV1king</b> <br>
      <p> I was a 3D art graduate but found it difficult to find motivation to create art professionally.
  I find <em>peace and satisfaction in coding.</em> I can't really describe the feeling but if you're here
      I'm sure you understand. </p>

- 👀 <b>I’m interested in Software Development/Engineering mainly but have other fields in mind!</b>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript <br>
      <p> I plan on educating myself on other things like <em>Python, React, reverse-engineering, and creating mmo addons (usually done with Lua)</em> </p>

- 💞️ <b>I’m looking to collaborate on <em>Open Source</em> projects in the near future</b><br>
      <p>This is something I can't wait to do, just going through GitHub and contributing everywhere I feel passionate about.</p>

- 📫 <b>How to reach me: <em>LinkedIn</em> for now (on my profile)</b>
